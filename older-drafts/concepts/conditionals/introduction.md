# Introduction

Conditional evaluation is one of the handful of ways that Julia offers to _control the flow_ of your program.

There are three primary ways to achieve this in Julia:

- `if`-expressions
- The ternary operator
- Short-circuit evaluation

Suppose you need a program to execute a certain set of statements, given that the conditional expression is satisfied, then we structure the code according to the syntax that Julia provides, as listed above.
